Problem Statement
Who-This problem affects everyone looking to download files off of the internet.
What-The problem is a loss of time due to putting each individual file in a certain directory. Also, the file could be lost if you do not specify a certain directory and just download the file.
When-This issue occurs whenever a file is downloaded from your computer.
Where-The problem occurs on every computer without a built-in file organizer.
Why-If this problem were fixed there would be a lesser chance of lost files and downloading files would take less time because you do not need to specify a directory explicitly.
We want a file organizer that watches specified directories 
Challenges
-Creating the GUI
-Moving files from one directory to another
-Finding the file extension
-Having the program run in the background of your computer
-Having the app start up when the operating system starts up
-Pinning the GUI to the tray on the windows taskbar
-Watching the directories for a file being downloaded there
