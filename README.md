# FileOrganizer
File organizer where you input directories you want the app to watch and then input directories you want certain files to go into
once something has been created in one of the watched directories. When a file is downloaded in one of the directories that is being 
watched it will be moved to the appropriate directory based on your specifications for each file type.
