The File Organizer will work by popping up a two windows upon starting the application. One of these windows will allow the user to input
directories that they want our application to watch with a maximum of 10 directories to be registered at a time. The other window will 
allow the user to specify which directories they want certain file types to be moved to. After these specifications are made, the user can
minimize the windows and allow the application to run in the background. Whenever the user downloads a file into one of the directories 
being watched, the type of file will be identified and moved to the appropriate directory. I am attempting to get my GUI to interact with a
config file in the form of a CSV text file in order to save the users settings if the application were to be closed. In that case, when 
the application starts again. The config file will be read and the directories inside will be set up to be watched appropriately. 
Things We Have Done:
-Partial completion of the window where user can specify which directories they want to be watched
-Config file
-Partial completion of the config file reader
-Partial completion of the window where user can specify which file tyes go where
-Directory Validator
-DirectoryNotFoundException
-DirectoryWatcher(watches the specified directories and queues an event if something is created in it). About 85% finished, but
still need to look at the file extension after it's notified in order to know where to nove it.
Things We Still Need:
-File mover that will move a file from one directory to another
-Give the two windows the functionality to edit the config file to allow changes made by the user to be saved
-completion of the directory watcher
-File extension identifier
